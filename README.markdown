gdb-regview
===========

This gdb plugin makes viewing MCU register contents from gdb easier and more convenient. Originally targeted at STM32 microcontrollers. Uses xml register definition files. May require appropriate debugger probe support for the intended target.

### Usage

From gdb, first load the plugin, then load the desired definitions xml, and finally show register contents:

`(gdb) source /path/to/gdb-regview.py`

`(gdb) regview load /path/to/definitions.xml`
OR
`(gdb) regview loadsvd /path/to/definitions.svd`

`(gdb) regview show REGISTER_NAME`

Tab completion is enabled for register names. One may wish to automatically load the plugin and register definitions using a `.gdbinit` file.

### Register Definitions (XML)

Register definitions loaded with "regview load" use the format defined by the Eclipse Embedded Systems Register View [(http://sourceforge.net/projects/embsysregview/)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/embsysregview/). In fact, it is recommended to use the register definition xml files included in this project.

A sample of STM32 register definitions are included in the `./defs` directory. The complete collection is available here: [http://sourceforge.net/p/embsysregview/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/org.eclipse.cdt.embsysregview.data/data/](http://sourceforge.net/p/embsysregview/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/org.eclipse.cdt.embsysregview.data/data/)

### Register Definitions (SVD)

Register definitions loaded with "regview loadsvd" use the CMSIS System View Description format (CMSIS-SVD). See: [http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/SVD/html/index.html](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/SVD/html/index.html)

A sample of an SVD is included in the `./svds` directory.

### Register Name Modification

In order to make accessing registers for groups of peripherals, the register name is modified compared to how it is available in the embsysregview xml files. Rather than `periph_registername`, the registers are referenced as `registergroup_registername`.

For example, on an STM32, there are several ADCs: `ADC1`, `ADC2`, etc. Each ADC has an `ADC_CR` register, which will be referenced as `ADC1_CR` (which is closer to the representation in the datasheet/reference manual).
